# Root Zone Soil Moisture (L4, 12z Instantaneous, Model Value-Added)
Temporal coverage: 31 March 2015 - present

The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) “Root Zone Soil Moisture (L4, 12z Instantaneous, Model Value-Added)” layer displays model-derived global estimates of root zone soil moisture of the top 100 cm of the soil column in m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>. Root zone soil moisture estimates are obtained by merging SMAP observations with estimates from a land surface model in a soil moisture ensemble Kalman data assimilation system.  12z (or 12:00:00 UTC) indicates the time of the analysis update.  

The SMAP spacecraft carries two instruments, a radar (active) and a radiometer (passive), that together make global measurements of land surface soil moisture and freeze/thaw state. It is useful for monitoring and predicting natural hazards such as floods and droughts, understanding the linkages between Earth’s water, energy and carbon cycles, and reducing uncertainties in predicting weather and climate.
