# AMSR-E Surface Rain Rate (Day/Night)
Temporal coverage: 18 June 2002 - 4 October 2011

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) "Surface Rain Rate (Day)" layer displays instantaneous rain rate in millimeters per hour for the 1:30 a.m. ascending (day) and the 1:30 p.m. descending (night) half-orbit passes of the AMSR-E B feedhorn. Surface rain rate is derived from brightness temperatures by modeling the absorption and scattering effects of rainfall on microwave emissions for specified cloud temperatures, water vapor, and hydro meteor profiles.

Onboard NASA's Aqua satellite, the AMSR-E radiometer measured terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters used to investigate global water and energy cycles.
