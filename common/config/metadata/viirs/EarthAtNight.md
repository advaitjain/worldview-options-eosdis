#VIIRS Nighttime Radiances (Day/Night Band, Enhanced Near Constant Contrast)

The VIIRS Day/Night Band layer shows the earthâ€™s surface and atmosphere using a sensor designed to look at the earth under differing illumination conditions, especially low light conditions, during the night time satellite orbit. It is displayed as a grey scale image. Sources of illumination include lunar reflection and both natural and anthropogenic night time light emissions. Lunar reflection can be used to highlight the location of clouds and terrestrial features such as sea ice and snow cover when there is partial to full moon conditions. When there is no moonlight, natural and anthropogenic night time light emissions are highlighted such as city lights, lightning, auroras, fires, gas flares, fishing fleets and lava flows. This layer is useful for showing patterns of human activity such as cities and highways, tracking of shipping and fishing fleets at night and burning of waste natural gas (gas flares) from on and off shore oil/gas production sites.

The VIIRS Day/Night Band layer is available from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite. The sensor resolution is 750 m at nadir, imagery resolution is 500m, temporal resolution is daily and temporal availability for viewing in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 5 December 2016 - present.

# Earth at Night 2012: VIIRS City Lights 2012
The Earth at Night layer is a night time view of the Earth, showing visible light emanating from sources such as city lights, gas flares, wildfires, auroras and reflected moonlight. The image is a composite of data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument on board the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. The image composite was assembled from clear, cloud free images from 9 days in April 2012 and 13 days in October 2012.

Currently, the Earth at Night imagery is available only as a single snapshot in time. The sensor resolution is 750 m and the image resolution is 500 m. The imagery can be visualized in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS). The imagery can be downloaded from [NASA Earth Observatory/Visible Earth](http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=79765).
